## Hey 👋, I'm Xiatao

### 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a master student majoring in Robotics at the University of Pennsylvania. I received my B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I'm interested in applying learning-based methods to solve problems in robotics. I am also working on some side projects in game development in my spare time.
